#Rivalry

Rivalry is similar to Amazon's "Customers who viewed this item also viewed..." except:
1. Rivalry's results encapsulate the entire industry of products -- not just a product's immediate rivals.
2. Rivalry creates a popularity ranking of products.
3. Rivalry is applicable to anything -- abstract ideas, people, brand, products, companies, countries, organizations, food, lifestyles, religion, ... the list goes on.

##Key ideas
* The key idea is to rank a product's competitors based on search frequency.
* "The rival of my rival is my rival."
* There are 'golden standards' that people will often compare things to -- Rivalry captures that and produced a ranking.

##Characteristics of search results
* The industry of your search results will be centered around the target market of your product
	- For example -- if you type in 'Audi', your search results will be biased towards luxury vehicles (people tend to cross-shop Audis with BMWs moreso than Hondas), whereas if you type in 'Toyota', the resulting search results will be biased towards standard vehicles.
* Keeping in mind the above, the ranking produced is very robust with respect to the input
  	- For example -- whether you type in 'Coke', 'Pepsi', or 'Sprite', you will see Coke as #1 and Pepsi as #2.


Things I would like to do:
- [ ] Create a webpage allowing users to interact with a Rivalry agent
- [ ] Create a graph that visually describes the web of rivalries within an industry
